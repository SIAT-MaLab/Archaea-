Collection reference of Archaeal Viral Genomes
 
We collected a database for 202 Archaeal Viral Genomes as a reference from 3 sources:

(i) 97 reference archaeal viral genomes available in NCBI RefSeq as of December 2020.

(ii) 102 archaeal virus genomes provided in the studies of Iranzo et.al. The 59 duplicated genomes compared to the genomes in (i) were removed. What’s more, there were 16 genomes were labeled as “Proviruses” by Iranzo et.al. However, sequences of these proviruses have not been provided by the authors, for which reason, we used VirSorter to predict the provirus from the 16 genomes. By this means, 14 proviruses have been extracted from 14 genomes. Taken together, we got 41 archaeal virus genomes from this source. 

(iii) To complete the archaeal viral dataset, we included genomes of Methanobacterium virus Drs3, 43 new putative archaeal virus genomes identified from two depth profiles in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) oxygen minimum zone, 24 unknown archaeal viral populations detected by GVD and 8 genomes of smacoviruses that were found to infect Archaea. 

In total, the final archaeal virus database consisted of 202 archaeal viral genomes or fragments.
